<h1>Spending Tracker</h1>

Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.

<h2>MVP</h2>
The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail<br>
The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport<br>
The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.<br>
The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.

<h2>Possible Extensions</h2>
Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.<br>
The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.<br>
The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.<br>

<h1>Rules</h1>
The project must be built using only:<br>

HTML / CSS<br>
Ruby<br>
Sinatra<br>
PostgreSQL and the PG gem<br>

<h2>It must NOT use:</h2>

Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)<br>
JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.<br>
Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.<br>
Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.
